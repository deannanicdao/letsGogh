# T2A2 - Two-Way Marketplace Application
### Deanna Nicdao

#### R7.	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
It's been known that the road to success in art is a narrow one, largely due to the subjective nature of the market. This creates a tough environment for artists to successfully sell their artworks let alone acquire the funds for real estate to host art exhibitions and maintain a rental studio space. One approach to minimise costs is for artists is to exhibit their work online and create home studio spaces.

The internet has led to the increased exposure of art to a broader, even global, audience on several platforms, such as Etsy and Shopify. Etsy is a creative marketplace where craft supplies, homemade goods and vintage items can be sold. In contrast, Shopify is an eCommerce platform where general goods can sold and their marketing, sales and operations can be managed. With access to such platforms, more and more artists have embraced digital technology for its benefits of increasing their marketability and creating a convenient platform for their client interactions. 

Despite the freedoms gained from a digital platform, artists are left to navigate and judge which of the platforms would best cater their goals. For example, they must consider whether their products will remain within the strict guidelines of what is allowed to be sold on the Etsy marketplace. It's likely that one might outgrow the Etsy constraintsm, yet a transition to another platform will cost revenue and a potential loss of customers. Moreover, upfront costs such as subscription-based selling fees, payment processing fees, listing and transaction fees per product need to be considered for platforms like Shopify. 

#### R8.	Why is it a problem that needs solving?
The general way for minimising costs as a digital artist is through the use of larger social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. However, there is a lack of efficiency with the user experience for digital artists on social media sites due to the broad audience and applicability of the sites. Requests for commissions over direct messaging apps on these platforms can often get lost or lack organisation as the messenger applications are not built for logging requests for items. 

This application aims to provide a simple marketplace platform for digital artists to sell their pieces without the constraints of larger online platforms and for customers to request art without navigating through the noise of other product categories or general social media. Commissioned rates can be provided by the artist and clients will be able to purchase their existing listings from the site. The target audience is kept specific to digital artists to ensure an efficient user experience. By providing a platform specific for digital art trade, a cleaner user experience is provided for both ends of the marketplace clientele by redirecting the trade from an instant messenger to a trading platform with fewer constraints and a more favorably-tailored user journey.
